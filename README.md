# caption-viewer
A FiftyOne plugin to visualize captions per sample from any StringField

---

This plugin can display any `fo.StringField` type value alongside samples in
the FiftyOne app as a panel scoped to the modal view. The panel provides a
dropdown menu to select from available `fo.StringField` fields and dynamically
updates when cycling between samples.
